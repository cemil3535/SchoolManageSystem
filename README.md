# SchoolManageSystem

We are writing a school management system

We create a general class named Person to manage the information of students and teachers. The properties of this class are:
Name, Surname, Date of Birth.

A class named Person is created and public properties (get/set) containing these properties are defined.

In the Main method, several student and teacher objects are created from this class and their information is printed to the console.

# It is coded in C# language.
